# Span Link Context

The Span Link Context is a Context implementation for [pdata SpanLinks](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/pdata/ptrace/generated_spanlink.go), the Collector's internal representation for OTLP Span Link data.  This Context should be used when interacting with individual OTLP Span Links.

## Paths
In general, the Span Link Context supports accessing pdata using the field names from the [traces proto](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-proto/blob/main/opentelemetry/proto/trace/v1/trace.proto).  All integers are returned and set via `int64`.  All doubles are returned and set via `float64`.

The following paths are supported.

| path                                   | field accessed                                                                                                                                                                | type                                                                    |
